# Mastermind
## A Game of Numbers


![rubix_cube](assets/rubix_cube.jpg "rubix_cube")

This Mastermind game invites a player to guess digits for a randomly generated number
in the command line.

There are 3 modes of difficulty:

**Easy and Medium mode**: The player has to keep typing 4 digits until they guess the number.
Easy mode provides hints as to how many digits are correct, but not their position.
At the end of the game the player is informed about how many tries it took.

**Hard Mode**: Again, no hints and the player has to guess a 5 digit number.
At the end of the game, scores are logged in a CSV and the player is shown the
highest score for the respective game mode they played.

**Please note** numbers may be duplicated within the randomly generated number
